              Dehr addresses the excessive energy consumption and environmental impact associated with cloud-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. It provides a more eco-friendly solution by allowing users to store and share their health records locally through peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, reducing the need for energy-hungry data centers while ensuring secure data handling.

              Dehr minimizes carbon emissions by leveraging local storage and P2P data sharing, which avoids the significant energy usage of cloud storage solutions. By storing records on personal devices and facilitating direct communication over local networks, Dehr reduces the need for large-scale data centers, which are known to contribute heavily to global greenhouse gas emissions.

              In Dehr, data-sharing is facilitated through local networks. Healthcare professionals make the required health records available on a local area network, which patients can access by scanning a QR code. The data is then securely downloaded to the patientâ€™s device. For sharing back with healthcare providers, patients can generate a QR code that professionals scan to retrieve the data directly to their systems.
